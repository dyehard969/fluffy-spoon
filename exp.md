Here's what the change does:

When a transaction is found in the transaction history, instead of automatically skipping it, we now check if:
It has a "failed" status
Its error message contains the specific text "waiting for locator("tr.even-row.clickable-row")"
If both conditions are met, we'll retry processing the transaction instead of skipping it.
For all other cases (transactions with other statuses or different error messages), we maintain the original behavior of skipping them and marking them as "Already handled".
I've added a console log message for debugging purposes that will help track when these retries occur.
This implementation follows the clean code principles from your preferences by making a targeted change that solves the specific requirement without introducing unnecessary complexity or pattern changes. The code remains organized and maintains the existing logic flow while adding the new condition.
